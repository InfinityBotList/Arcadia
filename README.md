**Path update**

``PATH=/opt/homebrew/Cellar/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/7.2.0/bin:$PATH``

**Not always needed, try running ``make cross`` before doing the below**

Symlink ``gcc`` if needed by ring at ``/opt/homebrew/Cellar/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/7.2.0/bin`` based on the error you get

Replace 7.2.0 with whatever gcc version you need

``make push`` to push newly built lib. Mofidy according to your ssh ip

**If you face any build issues on macOS, try removing ``/opt/homebrew/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc`` and then ``ln -sf /opt/homebrew/bin/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu-cc /opt/homebrew/bin/x86_64-linux-gnu-gcc``
